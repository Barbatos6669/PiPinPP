# PiPinPP v0.3.5 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Type:** Documentation & Branding Update (Patch Release)

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 0.3.5 is a **documentation-focused release** that significantly improves the beginner experience and clarifies the project's positioning. This release includes:

- ✅ **Terminology clarification** - "Arduino-inspired" not "Arduino-compatible"
- ✅ **Comprehensive beginner documentation** - Getting Started guide, Tutorials, FAQ
- ✅ **Troubleshooting guide** - Fix common issues independently
- ✅ **No functional changes** - Your existing code continues to work

**No code changes = No recompilation needed!** 

If you're already using v0.3.4, you can simply `git pull` to get the updated documentation.

## 📝 What's New

### 🏷️ Terminology Update

**Changed:** "Arduino-compatible" → "Arduino-inspired"

**Rationale:**
- Clarifies PiPin++ is a **Raspberry Pi** GPIO library
- API is **familiar** to Arduino users, not hardware-compatible
- Avoids confusion about Arduino hardware support
- Prevents potential trademark concerns

**Files updated:**
- Project descriptions (README, CMakeLists.txt)
- All documentation (29 files)
- Code comments in headers
- Examples and tests
- Release notes

**Your code is unaffected** - this is a documentation/branding change only.
