## Project Vision

**PiPin++** aims to make Raspberry Pi GPIO control easy and familiar for makers, especially those coming from Arduino. Our goal is a modern, lightweight, and extensible C++ library that feels instantly comfortable for Arduino users—removing the hassle of adapting to Pi-specific APIs.

## Why?

- **Arduino makers often struggle to migrate projects to Raspberry Pi**, facing steep learning curves and inconsistent libraries.
- **We want PiPin++ to bridge that gap** with a clean, intuitive API and modern C++ features.

## Who’s it for?

- Arduino users wanting to try Raspberry Pi projects
- Makers, hackers, students, educators
- Anyone needing simple, reliable GPIO control in C++

## Roadmap

**v0.2.0 COMPLETE!** ✅ All major Arduino compatibility features implemented!

### ✅ Completed Features (v0.2.0)

- ✅ **Digital input/output**: Arduino-style pin control (`pinMode`, `digitalWrite`, `digitalRead`)
- ✅ **Pin abstraction**: Simple, object-oriented pin management with RAII
- ✅ **Pull-up/pull-down resistors**: Built-in `INPUT_PULLUP` and `INPUT_PULLDOWN` support
- ✅ **Arduino API migration**: Easy transition from Arduino sketches
- ✅ **Complete examples**: LED control, button input, migration guide
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**: Full API reference and hardware setup guides

### Next Milestones (v0.3.0) - In Progress

- ✅ **Timing functions**: `millis()`, `micros()`, `delay()`, and `delayMicroseconds()` for precise timing
- [ ] **Interrupt support**: Edge detection with callback functions (`attachInterrupt`)
- [ ] **PWM support**: Arduino-style `analogWrite()` for motor control and LED dimming
- [ ] **Testing framework**: Comprehensive unit tests and continuous integration
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Fast GPIO operations and reduced overhead

### Longer-Term Goals (v0.4.0+)

- [ ] **Communication protocols**: I2C, SPI, and UART support
- [ ] **Multi-platform support**: Orange Pi and other ARM SBCs
- [ ] **Advanced features**: Analog input, GPIO monitoring tools
- [ ] **Development tools**: VS Code extensions and debugging utilities
