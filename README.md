## Project Vision

**PiPin++** aims to make Raspberry Pi GPIO control easy and familiar for makers, especially those coming from Arduino. Our goal is a modern, lightweight, and extensible C++ library that feels instantly comfortable for Arduino users‚Äîremoving the hassle of adapting to Pi-specific APIs.

## Why?

- **Arduino makers often struggle to migrate projects to Raspberry Pi**, facing steep learning curves and inconsistent libraries.
- **We want PiPin++ to bridge that gap** with a clean, intuitive API and modern C++ features.

## Who‚Äôs it for?

- Arduino users wanting to try Raspberry Pi projects
- Makers, hackers, students, educators
- Anyone needing simple, reliable GPIO control in C++

## Roadmap

This project is just getting started! Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre working toward:

### Planned Features

- **Digital input/output**: Arduino-style pin control (e.g. `pinMode`, `digitalWrite`, `digitalRead`)
- **Pin abstraction**: Simple, object-oriented pin management
- **Support for pull-up/pull-down resistors**
- **Easy API migration from Arduino sketches**
- **Low-level access for advanced users**
- **Extensible design for future protocols (PWM, I2C, SPI, UART, interrupts, etc.)**
- **Examples and migration guides** for Arduino users

### Near-Term Milestones

- [ ] Project scaffolding and setup
- [ ] Define core API and class structure
- [ ] Implement digital I/O basics
- [ ] Provide simple demo and usage instructions
- [ ] Gather feedback from Arduino and Pi communities

### Longer-Term Goals

- [ ] Add PWM, interrupts, and serial support
- [ ] More protocol helpers (I2C, SPI)
- [ ] Multi-platform support (other SBCs)
- [ ] Community-driven feature requests
