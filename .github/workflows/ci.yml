# GitHub Actions CI Workflow for PiPinPP
# This file tells GitHub how to automatically build and test our library

name: CI

# WHEN does this workflow run?
# - on every push to any branch
# - on every pull request
# This catches issues before they reach main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "**" ]  # ** means "all branches"
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "**" ]

# WHAT does this workflow do?
jobs:
  # Job 1: Cloud builds - Fast compilation validation
  cloud-build:
    name: Cloud Build (${{ matrix.build_type }}, ${{ matrix.os }})
    
    # WHERE does this run?
    # GitHub provides free Ubuntu virtual machines for open source projects
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    
    # STRATEGY: Test multiple configurations
    # This is called a "build matrix" - it runs the job multiple times
    # with different settings, helping us catch platform-specific issues
    strategy:
      # Don't cancel other jobs if one fails - we want to see all results
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        # Test on multiple Ubuntu versions to ensure compatibility
        os: [ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-24.04]
        # Test both Debug (with symbols for debugging) and Release (optimized)
        build_type: [Debug, Release]
    
    # STEPS: What actually happens in this job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code
      # actions/checkout is a pre-made GitHub Action that clones your repo
      # v4 is the version - always use latest stable version
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Step 2: Install base dependencies
      - name: Install base dependencies

        # We'll build v2.x from source in the next step
      
      # Step 3: Build and install libgpiod v2 from source
      # Ubuntu repos only have v1.x, but our code uses v2 API
      # This step downloads, builds, and installs libgpiod 2.2.1

        # Why this matters:
        # - Your code was written for libgpiod v2 API
        # - GitHub's Ubuntu images only have v1 in repos
        # - Building from source ensures we get v2.2.1
        # - This matches what's on your actual Raspberry Pi!
