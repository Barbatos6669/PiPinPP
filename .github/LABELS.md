# GitHub Labels Strategy

This document outlines the labeling system for organizing issues and pull requests in the PiPinPP repository.

## üè∑Ô∏è Label Categories

### Priority Labels
- **`next-release`** - High priority items for the immediate next version
- **`high-priority`** - Important features/fixes that should be addressed soon
- **`low-priority`** - Nice-to-have features that can wait
- **`future`** - Long-term goals for future major versions

### Issue Type Labels
- **`enhancement`** - New features or improvements to existing functionality
- **`bug`** - Something isn't working correctly
- **`documentation`** - Improvements or additions to documentation
- **`question`** - General questions about the project
- **`security`** - Security-related issues or improvements

### Difficulty/Experience Labels
- **`good first issue`** - Perfect for newcomers to the project
- **`help wanted`** - Looking for community contributions
- **`advanced`** - Requires deep knowledge of the codebase or domain

### Component Labels
- **`core-api`** - Related to the main Pin class and core functionality
- **`build-system`** - CMake, packaging, or build-related issues
- **`examples`** - Example programs and demonstration code
- **`testing`** - Test coverage, CI/CD, or testing infrastructure
- **`arduino-compat`** - Arduino API compatibility features

### Status Labels
- **`in-progress`** - Someone is actively working on this
- **`blocked`** - Cannot proceed due to external dependencies
- **`needs-review`** - Ready for code review
- **`wontfix`** - Valid issue but won't be addressed

### Platform Labels
- **`raspberry-pi`** - Specific to Raspberry Pi hardware
- **`linux`** - General Linux compatibility issues
- **`cross-platform`** - Multi-platform support features

## üéØ Recommended Label Combinations

### For New Contributors
- `good first issue` + `documentation` + `help wanted`
- `good first issue` + `examples` + `enhancement`

### For Arduino Migrants
- `arduino-compat` + `enhancement` + `next-release`
- `arduino-compat` + `documentation` + `help wanted`

### For Core Development
- `core-api` + `enhancement` + `high-priority`
- `core-api` + `bug` + `next-release`

### For Project Infrastructure
- `build-system` + `enhancement` + `low-priority`
- `testing` + `help wanted` + `good first issue`

## üìã Issue Template Suggestions

When creating issues, consider these templates:

### Feature Request
```
Labels: enhancement, help wanted
Milestone: v0.2.0 (if high priority)
```

### Bug Report
```
Labels: bug, needs-review
Priority: high-priority (if critical)
```

### Documentation Improvement
```
Labels: documentation, good first issue, help wanted
```

### Arduino Compatibility
```
Labels: arduino-compat, enhancement, next-release
```

## üöÄ Automation Opportunities

Consider setting up GitHub Actions to:
- Auto-label PRs based on changed files
- Auto-assign `good first issue` to new contributor PRs
- Move issues to project boards based on labels
- Generate roadmap progress based on closed issues with `next-release` label

## üìä Metrics to Track

- Number of `good first issue` items resolved by new contributors
- Percentage of `next-release` items completed per milestone
- Time from `help wanted` to PR submission
- Community engagement on `arduino-compat` features

*This labeling strategy should evolve with the project. Update as needed based on contributor feedback and project growth.*
