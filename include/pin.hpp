/**
 * @file Pin.hpp
 * @brief Object-oriented GPIO pin control using libgpiod on Raspberry Pi
 * 
 * @details
 * The Pin class provides a clean, Arduino-style C++ interface for interacting with
 * GPIO pins via the libgpiod library. It abstracts low-level chip and line operations
 * into a simple and reusable class that supports both input and output modes.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Simple constructor for selecting pin and direction
 * - Safe, RAII-based GPIO line management
 * - High-level methods to write to or read from pins
 * - Configurable chip name (default: "gpiochip0")
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * #include "pin.hpp"
 * 
 * // Object-oriented style
 * Pin led(17, PinDirection::OUTPUT);
 * led.write(true);   // Set GPIO17 HIGH
 * led.write(false);  // Set GPIO17 LOW
 * 
 * Pin button(18, PinDirection::INPUT);
 * int state = button.read();
 * @endcode
 * 
 * For Arduino-style compatibility, see ArduinoCompat.hpp
 *
