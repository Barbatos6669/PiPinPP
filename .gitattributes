# .gitattributes - Configure GitHub language detection and repository statistics
#
# This file helps GitHub's linguist properly identify PiPinPP as a C++ project
# by excluding documentation and configuration files from language statistics.

# Documentation files - mark as documentation to exclude from language stats
*.md linguist-documentation

# Configuration and build files - mark as vendored to exclude from language stats
CMakeLists.txt linguist-vendored
*.cmake linguist-vendored
*.in linguist-vendored
*.sh linguist-vendored

# Ensure C++ files are properly detected as C++
*.cpp linguist-language=C++
*.hpp linguist-language=C++
*.h linguist-language=C++

# Keep examples visible in language statistics (they demonstrate the library's usage)
examples/**/*.cpp linguist-detectable=true
examples/**/*.hpp linguist-detectable=true

# Tests are important to show but don't dominate the language stats
tests/*.cpp linguist-language=C++
