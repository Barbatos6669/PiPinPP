/**
 * @file basic_led/main.cpp
 * @brief Basic LED control using object-oriented Pin class
 * 
 * This example demonstrates the core Pin class functionality for controlling
 * an LED connected to GPIO pin 17. It shows the object-oriented approach
 * to GPIO control without Arduino compatibility layer.
 * 
 * Hardware Setup:
 * - Connect LED positive (long leg) to GPIO pin 17
 * - Connect LED negative (short leg) to GND through 220Î© resistor
 * 
 * @author PiPinPP Team
 * @version 0.2.0
