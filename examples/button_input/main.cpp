/**
 * @file button_input/main.cpp
 * @brief Button input reading with Arduino-style API and debouncing
 * 
 * This example demonstrates reading digital input from a button using the
 * Arduino compatibility layer. It includes proper debouncing to handle
 * mechanical switch bounce and shows both immediate and debounced readings.
 * 
 * Hardware Setup:
 * - Connect button one terminal to GPIO pin 18
 * - Connect button other terminal to GND
 * - Pin 18 will use internal pull-up resistor (when implemented)
 * - For now, add external 10kÎ© pull-up resistor to 3.3V
